Here is a fun way to create a mini children's book.

All you need is:

* One sheet of paper
* Scissors
* Pen (or anything to draw with).

I used to do this all the time with my kids. I had forgotten all about it. Then the other day I found one of our old books. It reminded me of the fun we used to have making them.

I was so excited to start making them again that I recorded this short video to show how I do it.

Make your own and share your creations with me on [my Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/drawingstobook). I'd love to see what you come up with. :)

Enjoy!
