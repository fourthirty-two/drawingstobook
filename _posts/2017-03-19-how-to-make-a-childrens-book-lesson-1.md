This series is an introduction to making a children's book for beginners. My goal is to show how you can create your first book using only a pen and paper and your mobile phone.

I used this method to make my own book <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqdQPT" target="_blank">that I was able to add to the Amazon book store</a>.

# In this lesson...

This first video covers ways to come up with ideas for stories and artwork. One example is a simple method that involves _"scribble drawing"_. A way to visualize your pages, story and drawings.
