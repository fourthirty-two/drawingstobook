This series is an introduction to making a children's book. My goal is to show how you can create your first book using only a pen, paper and your mobile phone.

I used this method to make my own book <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqdQPT" target="_blank">that I was able to add to the Amazon book store</a>.

# In this lesson...

This is third video in the series. Scanning and coloring the artwork using my phone.

I did it all using the amazing **Autodesk SketchBook** app. It's free and available for iPhone and Android phones.

You can get the Autodesk SketchBook app here - [https://www.sketchbook.com/mobile](https://www.sketchbook.com/mobile)

You can watch lesson 2 here - [_Sketching, layout & inking_](/blog/2017/03/19/how-to-make-a-childrens-book-lesson-1/) <br>
An easy way to think about drawing.

**Just a reminder...** this isn't just for people who know how to draw or use Photoshop. This is about learning how to make a book. I think everyone should be able to do this and express themselves. Learn by doing and having fun!

I hope this gives you the push you need to get started and make your own books to share with the world.
