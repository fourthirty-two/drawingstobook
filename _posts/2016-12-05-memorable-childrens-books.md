In 2010 children's books made up 25% of the overall book market.

And in the past few years there has been more effort to deliver those books in a more accessible format. Which is why I think it's important to know how to create digital books. Not only is it a lower cost to schools and organizations, but the overall cost to the person making them is pretty much nothing.

Much like the motto of today's web developers, I think the saying is true for authors and illustrators...

**"Design for mobile first"**.
