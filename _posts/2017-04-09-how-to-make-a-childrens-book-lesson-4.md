This series is an introduction to making a children's book. My goal is to show how I created a book using only a pen, paper and your mobile phone.

After using this method  <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqdQPT" target="_blank">I was even able to add the book to the Amazon Kindle book store</a>.

# In this lesson...

This is fourth and final video in the series. Laying out the pages, adding the text and exporting the finished book. All of this was done using my phone.

I did this with the **Google Slides** app. It's free and available for iPhone and Android phones (you will need to create a google account if you don't already have one.)

Previous Lesson - [_Scanning & coloring the artwork with my phone using the Autodesk SketchBook app_](/blog/2017/04/02/how-to-make-a-childrens-book-lesson-3/)

**Just a reminder...** this isn't just for people who know how to draw or use graphic software. This is about learning how to make a book. I think everyone should be able to do this and express themselves. Learn by doing and having fun!

I hope this gives you the push you need to get started and make your own books to share with the world.
