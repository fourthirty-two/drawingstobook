This series is an introduction to making a children's book. My goal is to show how you can create your first book using only a pen, paper and your mobile phone.

I used this method to make my own book <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqdQPT" target="_blank">that I was able to add to the Amazon book store</a>.

# In this lesson...

This is second video in the series. It's time to get into drawing.

I'm going to walk through the steps I used to brainstorm the pages for my own book.

**This includes:**

* Character drawing concepts [(using the 5-10 second rule I talked about last time)](/blog/2017/03/19/how-to-make-a-childrens-book-lesson-1/).
* Finding the character "feel" as you draw.
* Page layouts and actions
* Page Storyboards
* Sketching the pages
* Inking the artwork

You can watch lesson 1 here - [_The "scribble sketch" method_](/blog/2017/03/19/how-to-make-a-childrens-book-lesson-1/) <br>
An easy way to think about drawing.

**Just a reminder...** this isn't just for people who know how to draw. This is about learning how to make a book. I think everyone should be able to do this and express themselves. Learn by doing and having fun!

I hope this gives you the push you need to get started and make your own books to share with the world.
