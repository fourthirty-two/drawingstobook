I wanted to talk to
you a little bit today about moving
forward with your creative ideas and
making time for them.

First of all, the
biggest mistake people make is not
writing them down.

Lucky enough, today
we all have cell phones, we don't
have to carry around a pen and paper
anymore. Although it probably would be
nice to start if you are actually working on a
book idea. You can always quickly sketch
something that you see or
that you think of. So maybe having both is a good habit to start.

There are drawing programs for your phone that you can do
quick sketches with. Programs like [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)
or some of the other art programs that
are out there, one that i particularly
like it's called [Autodesk Sketchbook](https://www.sketchbook.com/mobile).

The most important thing is, when you get
these ideas it only takes a second to write it
down so you don't forget.

I always think _"oh I'll remember that later"_.

But, most of the time, I remember that
I **had** an idea, but not what it was. It's like there
was a post-it note in my head that fell
down. I know there used to be a
post-it note there, but now it's gone.

The other thing that can hold us back is thinking
that there's not enough time to make something.

With the technology we have that
I mentioned before, we can take the time, even just a little bit
at any moment in the day. When I'm sitting on
the couch -- instead of looking at Facebook
I take a few minutes to work on my idea.

I maybe have a pad of paper and doodle
some sketches. Any little bit helps.

The reason is because, when I move forward later I
don't have to start from scratch.
This is how I make the time when I
create my book. I don't have to do it all in one sitting

I can refer back to any number of
notes or drawings I have. So a good thing to remember is
use what you have on hand to keep ideas and help move
creativity forward.

Hopefully, looking back at these notes will inspire
me to get going. The more I collect
the more I think to myself, _"I may
actually finish this!"_

I just wanted to share this and say: **There's always time.
It doesn't have to
be a lot to make a difference.**

It's little things like this that can help.
