Page and Post Templates
=======================

These files are predefined with all the yaml front matter needed for posts and
pages.

Open a file for new posts then `save file as` to the section needed so the files
can be re-used.

**Important** Jekyll requires blog post files `post.md` to be named according to
the following format:
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`
