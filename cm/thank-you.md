"I want to make a children's book...  I just don't know how to start!"
======================================================================

Sound familiar?

If you're reading this right now, I'm guessing it's because you have a story _(or you'd like to write a story soon)..._

...and you know you should just start it.

But when was the last time you made a post? And when you did post, was it something truly unique and original?

But how the heck are you supposed to crank out new content day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-month when you've got a business to run?

It's practically impossible, and I'm betting you know that or you wouldn't still be reading this.

That's why the solution isn't more information.

You don't need to be told what you should do…

**...you need a shortcut for getting it DONE.**

In other words, you need an "Engine" that can crank out different types of high-quality content _(that keeps your blog fresh and your audience engaged)_ for you day after day.

That's why we created...

The "Content Engine"
====================

The Content Engine is a proven method for producing share-worthy, clickable content that you can actually be proud to publish.

And when you use this same Content Engine process, you’ll have the tools to:

* Create a Blog Content plan in 60 seconds (or less)...
* Quickly create stellar blog content fast (in fact, each one of these is either fully or partially able to be outsourced)...
* Find the best writers for your blog (including one method you should avoid like the plague)...
* Turn blog posts into lead & sales generating machines by inserting our proven call to action templates...
* Locate and re-purpose old content that can drive more traffic, leads and sales so that you don’t need to create anything new.

...and so much more!

Best of all, the process is nearly 100% turnkey thanks to our...

7 "Fill-In-The-Blank" Blog Post Templates
=========================================

The result was these 7 proven blog post templates:

* **TEMPLATE #1: "The Content Aggregator"** allows you to leverage other people's content to create a proven winner before you even press the "Publish" button.
* **TEMPLATE #2: "The Embed Reactor"** helps you create high-quality blog content you can be proud of - FAST _(even if you're not an expert)._
