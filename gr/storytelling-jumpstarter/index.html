<h1 id="i-want-to-make-a-childrens-book-i-just-dont-know-how-to-start">“I want to make a children’s book… I just don’t know how to start!”</h1>

<h2 id="sound-familiar">Sound familiar?</h2>

<p>If you’re reading this right now, I’m guessing it’s because you have an idea for a children’s book (or you’d like to write a story soon)…</p>

<p>…and you know you should just start it.</p>

<p>But have you ever written a picture book before? Do you need help thinking of something truly unique?</p>

<p>How the heck are you supposed to think of a new story, draw the pictures, and then match the pictures to the story?</p>

<p>It seems practically impossible, and I’m betting you know that or you wouldn’t still be reading this.</p>

<p><strong>You need some direction to help get you STARTED.</strong></p>

<h1 id="fact-its-easier-than-ever-to-create-your-own-books">FACT: It’s easier than ever to create your own books!</h1>

<p>And this isn’t something I’ve made up…it isn’t even just my opinion.</p>

<p>That’s right…most people already have the tools and the ability to create a children’s book, even if they have no idea what to write about, cannot draw, or have never written a book before.</p>

<p>You could just dive in and start drawing and writing…But over time it can get frustrating, keeping you from finishing because it seems so scattered.</p>

<p>What you need is a method that can help you not just finish one book…But one that you can use over and over, to make several books. Keep coming up with new story ideas after you have written your first!</p>

<p>You need a “Guide” that can show you how to arrange your ideas (figure everything out before you get to far, keep you from getting frustrated).</p>

<p>That’s why I created…</p>

<h1 id="the-storytelling-jumpstarter">The “Storytelling Jumpstarter”</h1>

<p>The Storytelling Jumpstarter is a method for pre-production, to help you get on your way to creating a children’s book that you can publish.</p>

<p>(But don’t worry…as you’ll soon see it doesn’t cost very much, and if you do it right you can actually generate more books over time using the same lesson.)</p>

<p>Through a lot of research and trial and error, I created a technique that can be followed for each new project.</p>

<p>When I was finished, I had a simple, easy-to-follow “Execution Plan”.</p>

<p>Here’s a sampling of what’s covered in this plan…</p>

<ul>
<li>Ways to find story ideas for your books (one method has even been used several times by a certain animation company)…</li>
<li>Plan your story idea with ease…</li>
<li>Quickly brainstorm what should be on each page (without wasting time time down the road)… ☺</li>
<li>Turn your pictures & words into finished ideas early on, so you focus…</li>
<li>The “AH-HA” tactic you can use to come up with multiple ideas for a story to market…</li>
<li>How to save valuable time by getting an idea of what your book should look like early on…</li>
<li>How to use Google to keep you story updated</li>
<li>Examples of my own to guide you can use  as a “Cheat Sheet” to help with your success…</li>
</ul>

<p>…and best of all, the process can be used over &amp; over again.</p>

<p>Personally, I wasted so much time not having a proper strategy and step-by-step guide to follow. This is especially true if you’re just starting out.</p>

<p>I mean it…</p>

<h1 id="dont-start-a-childrens-book-until-you-watch-this-guide">Don’t Start A Children’s Book Until You Watch This Guide</h1>

<p>I’ve already done all the hard work, made all the mistakes and figured out what works (and what doesn’t). And believe me, I made some mistakes a few times along the way…</p>

<p>…and I do this stuff all the time!!</p>

<p>That’s why I was so careful to document WHAT WORKS into simple, easy-to-follow execution plan so everyone can duplicate these results.</p>

<p>In the past these Execution Plans were mine alone, but now I’m making them available to the public. (You’ll see why in just a bit.)</p>

<p>So now you don’t have to go it alone!</p>

<p>Normally these Execution Plans sell for up to $47 - $97, but I’ll let you have instant access to this plan for just $7.</p>

<p>Yep…$7.</p>

<p>Literally, you can have one of those fancy coffees at Starbucks or you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start thinking of stories for books that you can sell on the internet (by searching thousands of ideas that are ready and waiting for you)</li>
<li>Save time (by not having to learn how to layout your ideas on your own)</li>
<li>Avoid potential mistakes that keep you from finishing your book</li>
<li>Create a family project that your kids,grandkids or students can be a part of while learning a valuable skill (and not even realizing it!)</li>
<li>Avoid potentially-embarrassing “rookie” mistakes</li>
<li>Go from starting one book, to creating a few dozen or even more…</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice is yours…</p>

<p>Click the “Add To Cart” button and start writing your children’s book in 5 minutes…</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>What’s an Execution Plan?</strong></p>

<p>It’s not quite a course and it’s definitely not just an ordinary report or whitepaper…</p>

<p>…an Execution Plan is more like a “visual guide on steroids!”</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>In the last few years I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Invested thousands of hours on researching…</li>
<li>Tried many different techniques…</li>
<li>Watched well over the normal amount of videos and tutorials…</li>
</ul>

<p>…all on my own.</p>

<p>And along the way I have perfected a large number of strategies and tactics. More importantly, I DOCUMENTED each strategy in step-by-step “Execution Plans” so the best ideas could be repeated and rolled out for others to use.</p>

<p>They’re all meat and no fluff. If you want backstory and theory, go read a blog post. Execution Plans are all about taking action and getting results as quickly and easily as possible.</p>

<h2 id="why-7">Why $7?</h2>

<p>If you’re thinking “$7 is cheap…what’s the catch?” then here are three reasons that should put your mind at ease:</p>

<ol>
<li>$7 puts this information within the reach of everyone…from first time authors to parents/grandparents and even teachers. ☺</li>
<li>It weeds out the freebie-seekers. In my experience charging anything…even if it’s just $1…gets rid of 99% of the people that aren't actually serious about making something.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also believe that once you experience this Execution Plan, you’ll want more and maybe…just maybe…you’ll come back, buy more and possibly even upgrade to Drawings To Book Pro, where you get access to our complete Execution Plan Library.</p>

<p>That’s it…</p>

<p><strong>How long will it take to get access to this guide?</strong></p>

<p>Immediate.</p>

<p>Your access information will be sent to the email address you provide.</p>

<p>Yes…My very first book created using these methods.</p>

<p>Not only will you get a copy of the book as an example with your <strong>Storytelling Jumpstarter</strong> download but, just to show you what you can do with your book if you take the entire <strong>Drawings To Book Pro</strong> course <a style="display:inline;" href="http://amzn.to/2eaap94">it’s available as a digital book on Amazon in the Kindle Store!</a> </p>
