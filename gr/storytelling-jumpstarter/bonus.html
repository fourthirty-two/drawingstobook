<h1>
  "I want to make a children's book...  I just don't know how to start!"
</h1>

<p>
  Sound familiar?
</p>

<p>
  If you're reading this right now, I'm guessing it's because you have an idea for a children's picture book <i>(or you'd like to write a story soon)...</i>
</p>

<p>
  ...and you know you should just start it.
</p>

<p>
  But have you ever written a picture book before? Do you need help thinking something truly unique?
</p>

<p>
  How the heck are you supposed begin a new story and match the pictures, and the story?
</p>

<p>
  It seems practically impossible, and I'm betting you know that or you wouldn't still be reading this.
</p>

<p>
  <b>You need some direction to help get you STARTED.</b>
</p>

<p>
  In other words, you need an "Guide" that can show you how to arrange your ideas <i>(figure everything out before you get to far, keep you from getting frustrated).</i>
</p>

<p>
  That's why we created...
</p>

<h1>
  The "Storytelling Jumpstarter"
</h1>

<p>
  The Storytelling Jumpstarter is a method for pre-production, help get on your way to creating a picture book that you can actually be proud to publish.
</p>

<p>
  And when you use this same "Jumpstarter" process, you'll have the tools to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Plan your story idea with ease...
  </li>
  <li>
    Quickly brainstorm what should be on each page (without waisting time down the road)...
  </li>
  <li>
    Ways to find story ideas for your book (one method has even been used several times by a certain animation company)...
  </li>
  <li>
    Turn your pictures & words into finished ideas early on, so you focus...
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Best of all, the process can be used over & over again...
</p>
