It's not about just writing a children's book. It's about you and your kids learning together.

Nobody starts out being great in any creative field. They try it on they're own. For themselves because it speaks to them and they want to do more.

Parents cook with their kids to bond and show them how to do a certain thing. The same should be true for cretive outlets. You want to make children's books, draw and write. So do your kids, and if you bring them in to the fold, even in the slightest way, it will help shape the creative path for both of you.
