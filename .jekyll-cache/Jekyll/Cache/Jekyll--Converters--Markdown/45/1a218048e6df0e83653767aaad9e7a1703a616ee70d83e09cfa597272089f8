<blockquote>
  <p><em>Casablanca, Morocco in December 1941, a cynical American expatriate meets a former lover, with unforeseen complications.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Casablanca was an A-list film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to be anything out of the ordinary. It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year.</p>

<p>Casablanca was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.</p>

<h1>But...</h1>

<p>Casablanca went on to win three Academy Awards</p>

<ul>
  <li>Best Picture</li>
  <li>Best Director (Curtiz)</li>
  <li>Best Adapted Screenplay (the Epsteins and Koch)</li>
</ul>

<p>and gradually its reputation grew.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs lead characters, memorable lines, and pervasive theme song have all become iconic and the film consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films in history.</p>

<p>My point is this ‚Äì if you have something you want to create, you should.</p>

<p>You may think to yourself ‚Äì</p>

<p><strong><em>‚ÄúI‚Äôm just another person making a book or drawing. There are so many others out there doing the same thing, why should I bother? Who will care?‚Äù</em></strong></p>

<p>First of all, <em>YOU will care</em>.</p>

<p>It means something to you. No one should use other people‚Äôs success as an excuse to keep from being creative. Don‚Äôt think of them, think of what you want to become by making something that interests you.</p>

<p>And second, you don‚Äôt know who will care if it‚Äôs never made.</p>

<p>We have the ability to reach so many people these days, why not try? Or just do it for yourself.</p>

<p>It might not be Casablanca but it‚Äôs something to you.</p>
