I"<p>This series is an introduction to making a children’s book. My goal is to show how you can create your first book using only a pen, paper and your mobile phone.</p>

<p>I used this method to make my own book <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqdQPT" target="_blank">that I was able to add to the Amazon book store</a>.</p>

<h1 id="in-this-lesson">In this lesson…</h1>

<p>This is third video in the series. Scanning and coloring the artwork using my phone.</p>

<p>I did it all using the amazing <strong>Autodesk SketchBook</strong> app. It’s free and available for iPhone and Android phones.</p>

<p>You can get the Autodesk SketchBook app here - <a href="https://www.sketchbook.com/mobile">https://www.sketchbook.com/mobile</a></p>

<p><strong>Just a reminder…</strong> this isn’t just for people who know how to draw or use Photoshop. This is about learning how to make a book. I think everyone should be able to do this and express themselves. Learn by doing and having fun!</p>

<p>I hope this gives you the push you need to get started and make your own books to share with the world.</p>
