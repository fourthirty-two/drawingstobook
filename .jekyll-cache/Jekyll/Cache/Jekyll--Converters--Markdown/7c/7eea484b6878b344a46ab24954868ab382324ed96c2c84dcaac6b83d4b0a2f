I"¡<p>Here is a fun way to create a mini childrenâ€™s book.</p>

<p>All you need is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One sheet of paper</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
  <li>Pen (or anything to draw with).</li>
</ul>

<p>I used to do this all the time with my kids. I had forgotten all about it. Then the other day I found one of our old books. It reminded me of the fun we used to have making them.</p>

<p>I was so excited to start making them again that I recorded this short video to show how I do it.</p>

<p>Make your own and share your creations with me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/drawingstobook">my Facebook page</a>. Iâ€™d love to see what you come up with. :)</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
