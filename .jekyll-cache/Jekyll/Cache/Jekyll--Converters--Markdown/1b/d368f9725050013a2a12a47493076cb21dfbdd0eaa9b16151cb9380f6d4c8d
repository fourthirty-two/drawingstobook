I"_<p>This series is an introduction to making a children’s book. My goal is to show how you can create your first book using only a pen, paper and your mobile phone.</p>

<p>I used this method to make my own book <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqdQPT" target="_blank">that I was able to add to the Amazon book store</a>.</p>

<h1 id="in-this-lesson">In this lesson…</h1>

<p>This is second video in the series. It’s time to get into drawing.</p>

<p>I’m going to walk through the steps I used to brainstorm the pages for my own book.</p>

<p><strong>This includes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Character drawing concepts <a href="/blog/2017/03/19/how-to-make-a-childrens-book-lesson-1/">(using the 5-10 second rule I talked about last time)</a>.</li>
  <li>Finding the character “feel” as you draw.</li>
  <li>Page layouts and actions</li>
  <li>Page Storyboards</li>
  <li>Sketching the pages</li>
  <li>Inking the artwork</li>
</ul>

You can watch lesson 1 here - <a href="/blog/2017/03/19/how-to-make-a-childrens-book-lesson-1/"><em>The “scribble sketch” method</em></a> <br />
An easy way to think about drawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Just a reminder…</strong> this isn’t just for people who know how to draw. This is about learning how to make a book. I think everyone should be able to do this and express themselves. Learn by doing and having fun!</p>

<p>I hope this gives you the push you need to get started and make your own books to share with the world.</p>
