I"q	<p>I wanted to talk to
you a little bit today about moving
forward with your creative ideas and
making time for them.</p>

<p>First of all, the
biggest mistake people make is not
writing them down.</p>

<p>Lucky enough, today
we all have cell phones, we don’t
have to carry around a pen and paper
anymore. Although it probably would be
nice to start if you are actually working on a
book idea. You can always quickly sketch
something that you see or
that you think of. So maybe having both is a good habit to start.</p>

<p>There are drawing programs for your phone that you can do
quick sketches with. Programs like <a href="https://keep.google.com/">Google Keep</a>
or some of the other art programs that
are out there, one that i particularly
like it’s called <a href="https://www.sketchbook.com/mobile">Autodesk Sketchbook</a>.</p>

<p>The most important thing is, when you get
these ideas it only takes a second to write it
down so you don’t forget.</p>

<p>I always think <em>“oh I’ll remember that later”</em>.</p>

<p>But, most of the time, I remember that
I <strong>had</strong> an idea, but not what it was. It’s like there
was a post-it note in my head that fell
down. I know there used to be a
post-it note there, but now it’s gone.</p>

<p>The other thing that can hold us back is thinking
that there’s not enough time to make something.</p>

<p>With the technology we have that
I mentioned before, we can take the time, even just a little bit
at any moment in the day. When I’m sitting on
the couch – instead of looking at Facebook
I take a few minutes to work on my idea.</p>

<p>I maybe have a pad of paper and doodle
some sketches. Any little bit helps.</p>

<p>The reason is because, when I move forward later I
don’t have to start from scratch.
This is how I make the time when I
create my book. I don’t have to do it all in one sitting</p>

<p>I can refer back to any number of
notes or drawings I have. So a good thing to remember is
use what you have on hand to keep ideas and help move
creativity forward.</p>

<p>Hopefully, looking back at these notes will inspire
me to get going. The more I collect
the more I think to myself, <em>“I may
actually finish this!”</em></p>

<p>I just wanted to share this and say: <strong>There’s always time.
It doesn’t have to
be a lot to make a difference.</strong></p>

<p>It’s little things like this that can help.</p>
