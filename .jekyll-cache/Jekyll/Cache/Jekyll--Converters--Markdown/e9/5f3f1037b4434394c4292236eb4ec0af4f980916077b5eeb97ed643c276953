I"		<p>This series is an introduction to making a children’s book. My goal is to show how I created a book using only a pen, paper and your mobile phone.</p>

<p>After using this method  <a href="http://amzn.to/2nqdQPT" target="_blank">I was even able to add the book to the Amazon Kindle book store</a>.</p>

<h1 id="in-this-lesson">In this lesson…</h1>

<p>This is fourth and final video in the series. Laying out the pages, adding the text and exporting the finished book. All of this was done using my phone.</p>

<p>I did this with the <strong>Google Slides</strong> app. It’s free and available for iPhone and Android phones (you will need to create a google account if you don’t already have one.)</p>

<p><strong>Just a reminder…</strong> this isn’t just for people who know how to draw or use graphic software. This is about learning how to make a book. I think everyone should be able to do this and express themselves. Learn by doing and having fun!</p>

<p>I hope this gives you the push you need to get started and make your own books to share with the world.</p>
